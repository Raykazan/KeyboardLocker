# KeyboardLocker
Tool to disable and re-enable the default keyboard.

This tool will lock the keyboard as you need.

The need to clean my keyboard led me to this solution. 
Hope this can help someone in any way.

For now it has been tested on my Kubuntu machine.

Any help or improvements are welcome!

The .desktop file has the Exec line commented, so you need to put the path and uncomment the line yourself.
